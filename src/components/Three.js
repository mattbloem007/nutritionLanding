        <p>
        My name is Matthew Bloemetje. We were designed to be extraordinary and I am just a regular human being on the path of becoming an extraordinary being.
        I am a graduated, yet ever learning Sangoma and Cacao Kuchina.
        My ancestral name is Gabriel, from the Archangel Gabriel, whom I am honoured to be working with.
        As a facilitator, I have been blessed to unlock the ancient knowledge about nutrition and body-work healing.
        I have a complex understanding about the inner and outer workings of the body and brain and how to best optimize their functioning.
